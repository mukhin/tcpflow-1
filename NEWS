Version 1.1.0-beta1 4 January 2012

Announcing tcpflow version 1.1 (beta 1).  Version 1.1 represents a
significant rewrite of tcpflow. All users are encouraged to evaluate
it; a final release will be made within the next two weeks.

Significant changes include:

* Entire code base migrated to C++ ; code generally
  improved. tcpflow's original hash table has been replaced with an
  STL map which should offer significantly more
  scalability. Eventually tcpflow will expire out old
  connections. This will finally end the program's memory-hogging
  problem. 

* Multiple connections with the same (source/destination) are now
  detected and stored in different files. This is significant, as the
  previous implementation would make a single file 1-2GB in
  length. Additional files have the same filename and a "c0001",
  "c0002" appended.

* Filenames may now be prefixed with a unix time_t of the time that
  the connection was first seen.

* The following options are now implemented:

  -o outdir --- now works (previously was not implemented)
  -X xmfile --- now reports execution results in a DFXML
                file. (Version 1.1 will include complete notion in the XML file of
                every TCP connection as a DFXML <fileobject>
  -Fc       --- Every file has the 'cXXXX' postfix, rather than just
                the files with duplicate source/destination.
  -Ft       --- Every file has the <time_t>T prefix.
  -mNNNN    --- Specifies the minimum number of bytes that need to be
                skipped in a TCP connection before a new 
  -Lname    --- use the named semaphore 'name' to prevent multiple tcpflow 
                processes printing to standard output from overprinting each other.

Other improvements from the widely available code base include:

* Support for IPv6

* Support for VLANs

* The default filter which was causing problems under MacOS has been removed.

tcpflow can be downloaded from:

Finally, becuase the previous maintainer had lost control of the old
tcpflow mailing list, a new one has been created at Google Groups. You

Version 1.0.4 November 24, 2011
* Default fitler changed to ""; previous default filter was causing problems on macs.

Version 1.0.2 September 30, 2011
* IPv6 code added

Version 1.0.0 January 2011
* Updated to support VLANs. VLAN packets are marked by hex 0x8100 following
  the destination and source mac addresses, followed by the 16-bit VLAN address,
  followed by 0x0800 marking the beginning of the traditional IP header.

Version 0.30 October 2007
* Simson Garfinkel <simsong@acm.org> is now the maintainer of this package
* Modified to set the time of each tcpflow with the time of the first packet.
* Created a regression test, so "make check" and "make distcheck" now work.
* Updated to modern autoconf tools.

Version 0.20 (February 26, 2001):

* A bug was fixed that caused out-of-order reassembly to generate
seemingly very large files on some systems (specifically, those that
support fgetpos/fsetpos).

* Bug fixed that caused the interface to be left in promiscuous mode
after tcpflow terminated

* The -r option was added, contributed by Jose M. Alcaide
<jose@we.lc.ehu.es>

* We now distribute tcpflow RPMs, thanks to a spec file submitted by
  Ross Golder <rossigee@bigfoot.com>.


Version 0.12 (April 20, 1999):

* Now compiles under IRIX, and using non-GCC compilers.

* Workaround for the Linux/libpcap bug that prevented tcpflow from
  listening to packets on the Linux loopback interface.  It's not
  perfect -- it appears impossible to install a libpcap filtering
  expression when listening to the Linux loopback interface.  Thus,
  *all* flows on that interface are recorded.  Someday I may try to
  fix either libpcap or the Linux kernel so that this workaround is
  not necessary.


Version 0.11 (April 13, 1999):

* Support for older (libc5) Linux systems (submitted by Johnny Tevessen
  <j.tevessen@gmx.net>).

* Some minor fixes.


Version 0.10 (April 12, 1999):

* First public release.
