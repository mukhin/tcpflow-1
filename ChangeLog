2012-01-03  Simson Garfinkel  <simsong@mncrnpsedu.local>

	* src/util.cpp (check_malloc): removed

	* src/tcpip.cpp (tcpip::store_packet): flow_state renamed tcpip (because it is).

	* src/flow.h (class flow_state): first is now called tstart and appears in the flow_t.

	(class flow_t): created this class which has additional per-flow information
	(class flow_addr): moved vlan to flow_t from flow_addr

2012-01-01  Simson Garfinkel  <simsong@Mucha.local>

	* src/tcpip.cpp: renamed from tcpip.c to tcpip.cpp

2011-10-13  Simson Garfinkel  <simsong@alphonse-mucha.home>

	* src/main.c (main): removed prepending of (ip or ip6 or vlan) from user expressions. We now just use what the user provided.

2011-09-20  Simson Garfinkel  <simsong@alphonse-mucha>

	* src/flow.c (open_file): replaced FGETPOS(flow_state->fp, &(flow_state->pos)) with ftell()

	* src/tcpip.c (store_packet): FSETPOS replaced with fseek (it's better now than in 1999)

	* src/util.c (flow_filename): vlan changed from [42] to --42 to avoid some shell issues.

	* Applied debian patch 20_fix-usage, which fixed the usage statement.

2011-02-27  Simson Garfinkel  <simsong@Silver-Surfer.local>

	* manually applied debian patch 10_extra-opts, which improves color rendering and passes the state structure, rather than forcing it to be re-calculated.

2008-10-06  Simson Garfinkel  <simsong@Silver-Surfer.local>

	* src/flow.c (flow_same): created a flow_same() function to return true if two flows are the same (because we will be adding additional information to the flow)
	(close_file): modified so that flows are timestamped with the time of the closing

	* src/tcpflow.h: reimplemented portable_signal to return void, rather than RETSIGTYPE, since RETSIGTYPE hasn't been used for at least 15 years.

	* src/sysdep.h: added #include <net/if_var.h> before #include <net/if.h>

	* configure.ac: rewrote to remove patches for circa 2002 Linux bugs. Fixed prerequisite header for net/if.h

2003-08-07  Jeremy Elson  <jelson@circlemud.org>
	* Released v0.21.  Sticking to my strict schedule of releasing at
	least one minor release per year. :-)
	
2003-08-07  Jeremy Elson  <jelson@circlemud.org>

	* src/main.c: Fixed format string attack.  Found by David
	Goldsmith of atstake.com.
	
2002-03-29  Jeremy Elson  <jelson@concorde.cs.ucla.edu>

	* configure.in: Fixed --with-pcap (was broken since moving sources
	into src)

2002-03-29  Jeremy Elson  <jelson@circlemud.org>

	* src/datalink.c: Added support for ISDN (/dev/ippp0), datalink
	handler for DLT_LINUX_SLL.  Contributed by Detlef Conradin
	<dconradin at gmx.net>

2001-08-23  Jeremy Elson  <jelson@circlemud.org>

	* src/tcpip.c: fflush stdout in console print mode, from
	suggestion of Andreas Schweitzer <andy at physast.uga.edu>, who
	says "Otherwise, I can't redirect or pipe the console output. At
	least on FreeBSD. I will check later today if this also cures the
	same problems I had on OpenBSD."
	

2001-02-26  Jeremy Elson  <jelson@circlemud.org>

	* Released version 0.20.
	
	* util.c, main.c: we now catch SIGTERM, SIGINT and SIGHUP, and
	call exit().  Should give libpcap a chance to reset the interface
	state (it calls onexit()).
	
	* main.c, tcpflow.1.in: Added patch from "Jose M. Alcaide" <jose
	at we.lc.ehu.es> (FreeBSD port maintainer) so that tcpflow can
	read from tcpdump output files.

2000-01-12  Jeremy Elson  <jelson@circlemud.org>

	* tcpflow.spec.in: New file for creating RPMs, submitted by Ross
	Golder <rossigee at bigfoot.com>.

	* configure.in: Added generation of tcpflow.spec
	* Makefile.am: Added distribution of tcpflow.spec.in

1999-04-20  Jeremy Elson  <jelson@circlemud.org>

	* Released version 0.12.
	
1999-04-20  Jeremy Elson  <jelson@circlemud.org>

	* tcpflow.1.in: Updated man page.

	* main.c (main): libpcap, when running under Linux, doesn't seem
	to be able to handle filtering expressions when using DLT_NULL
	(usually the loopback interface -- i.e. "localhost"), so we don't
	allow those expressions and print a warning if the user is trying
	to use one.  Controlled via the DLT_NULL_BROKEN define in conf.h.
	* datalink.c (dl_null): We no longer check that the datalink type
	is AF_INET if DLT_NULL_BROKEN is defined.
	* configure.in: Added AC_CANONICAL_SYSTEM, and define
	DLT_NO_BROKEN if we are using Linux.
	* acconfig.h: Added entry for DLT_NULL_BROKEN.

	* tcpflow.h: We use __attribute__ now only if __GNUC__ is defined,
	so that the code compiles on non-GCC compilers.
	
	* configure.in: Check for standards.h, for IRIX compatibility.
	(I have a custom autoconf that I changed to automatically #include
	standards.h, if the check succeeds, in future header file checks.)
	* sysdep.h: Conditional #include <standards.h> added.
	
	* configure.in: Only check for -lnsl if gethostbyaddr() doesn't
	work without it; same for -lsocket and socket().
	
	* tcpip.c (process_ip, process_tcp, do_strip_nonprint,
	print_packet, store_packet): Changed to take a u_char.
	* tcpflow.h: Changed packet handling function argument prototypes
	and return values to use u_char instead of char.
	* configure.in: Added checking for u_char.
	* acconfig.h: Added entry for u_char.

	* tcpip.c (process_ip, process_tcp): Added debugging messages.

	* tcpip.c (store_packet): Changed debug level of messages.

1999-04-14  Jeremy Elson  <jelson@circlemud.org>

	* tcpip.c (store_packet): Now correctly checking the return value
	of fwrite().  Pointed out by Johnny Tevessen <j.tevessen at gmx.net>.

1999-04-13  Jeremy Elson  <jelson@circlemud.org>

	* Released version 0.11.
	
1999-04-13  Jeremy Elson  <jelson@circlemud.org>

	* tcpip.c (process_ip): Portability: added typecast of an int to a
	long, and changed the printf format to use a long (%ld) instead of
	an int (%d).  This is because some systems define these variables
	as long to begin with.
	* tcpip.c (store_packet): Same thing.
	* util.c (init_debug): Same thing.

	* main.c (print_usage): Added function to give help.

	* sysdep.h: Linux libc5 systems have different names for certain
	structures.  Patch sent by Johnny Tevessen <j.tevessen at gmx.net>
	
	* configure.in: All system header files are now detected by
	autoconf and conditionally included in sysdep.h.
	* sydep.h: Same.
	* main.c: Same.
	* tcpip.c: Same.

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Changed from tcpflow.1 to tcpflow.1.in
	to reflect the fact that tcpflow.1 is now created by 'configure'.
	* configure.in: Same.
	* tcpflow.1.in: Same.
	
	* AUTHORS: Created & added initial entries.

1999-04-12  Jeremy Elson  <jelson@circlemud.org>

	* Initial public release.
